# College Machine-Learning-Projects
<h4> Main Summer Training Project Description</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Face Detection using opencv and CNN</li>
  <li> Detect Faces of people based on training dataset and identify using name </li>
</ul>
<h5><stong> Limitations </strong></h5>
<ul>
  <li> The trained dataset is not 90 % accuratae to classify the correct person based on the given image .</li>
  <li> Using GPU the training time required to complete whole training process is about 5 hrs based on 500 given image datasets. </li> 
</ul>
<h4>Other small side projects</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Drowsiness Detection based on given threshold value of eye closeness for certain  amount of time. </li>
  <li>Emotion Detection -> Here different expression of faces will be shown on live video or still images such as Smiling, angry, happy, sad, neutral. etc </li>
  <li> Poisonous Mushroom detection -> There is a test dataset given and I have to make a trained dataset and find out highest accuracy of correct percentage of detecting the poisonnous mushroom over the test data. [Dataset was taken from Kaggle]</li> 
  <li> Spam detection on number of messages recieved on phone. </li>
  <li> Find one object from many in a image </li>
  <li> Restoration of the torn image part using numpy </li>
</ul>
